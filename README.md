# Time series

Example code for chapter nine, [Clojure for Data Science](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/clojure-data-science).

## Data

This chapter makes use of two datasets: the [Longley](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/lls/data/LINKS/i-Longley.shtml) dataset and the Airline dataset from Box & Jenkins (1976).

Both datasets are included with the Incanter library.

## Running examples

Examples can be run with:

```bash
# Replace 9.1 with the example you want to run:

lein run -e 9.1
```
or open an interactive REPL with:

```bash
lein repl
```
